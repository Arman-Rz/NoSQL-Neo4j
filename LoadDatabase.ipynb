    "# Importing\n",
    "All the adjustments that we did to the tables were neccessary in order to use Neo4j Admin Import. According to the syntax of the Admin, it will look at the tables and search for the columns that are named in the form of \":ID(...)\", \":START_ID(...)\" and \":END_ID(...)\". Using these columns, it connects the tables together in order to form the relationships. In other words, the added columns to the node tables and the namings and :TYPE columns for the relationship tables are a part of its syntax. The \":ID(...)\" acts like a key for its table, while \":START_ID(...)\" and \":END_ID(...)\" act like a pointer to those keys depending on the name that is written in the parenthesese. This way, Admin can connect a customer in Customers table to a transaction in Transactions table under the name of MADE. The same goes for the OCCURRED_AT relationship. Note that these ajdustments are only for Admin. Therefore, the nodes created from these tables will not have a column named \":ID(...)\". Admin only uses those columns to form the relationships."
